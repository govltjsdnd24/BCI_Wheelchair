This is a project on robots being operated with the controller's brain waves, specifically their Motor Imagery Signal.
The signal is collected, processed, and transmitted to the robot, where the robot will receive the code and move according to it.
All of these are managed and received by Unity which acts as a visual representation and also a mode between the two machines.
